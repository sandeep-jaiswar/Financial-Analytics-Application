Welcome, Copilot! This repository contains the blueprint and codebase for a Financial Analytics Application. The application pulls comprehensive financial data using the YahooFinance API and stores it in ClickHouse. Our goal is to enable users to apply various quantitative models and strategies to uncover market opportunities efficiently and scalably.

Key Technologies
Backend: API integration with YahooFinance

Database: ClickHouse (optimized for analytical queries)

Data Processing/Models: Pluggable algorithmic modules (statistical, ML, quant)

Frontend: Data exploration, visualization, and strategy execution UI

Contribution and Copilot Guidance
Write modular, well-documented code.

Use clear, descriptive function and variable names.

Favor configuration-driven designs to ease extension (new tickers, models, etc.).

Aim for high throughput and reliability of data ingestion and processing.

Maintain robust error handling especially around API calls and DB operations.

All business logic related to market opportunity detection should be testable and reusable in isolation.

Core Feature Roadmap
API Layer: YahooFinance integration (fetch quotes, fundamentals, historical data, news)

Database Layer: ClickHouse schema for time series and fundamental data

Data Sync: Ingest and keep financial datasets updated

Analytics Engine: Pipeline for running models/algorithms (e.g., trend detection, mean reversion, ML quant models)

Web UI: Display, compare, and interact with market insights

Extensibility: Plugins for new models and custom strategies

Error Monitoring: Logging, alerts, health endpoints

Testing: Automated tests for ingestion, model logic, and REST endpoints

Coding Guidelines
Document all functions and modules with docstrings.

Write concise, comprehensible commits.

Keep secrets/configs out of the codebase.

Prefer asynchronous programming for I/O.

Validate all API and DB payloads.
